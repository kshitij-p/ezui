### For simple cases

<CodeCopyBlock>
  ```tsx
  <ScrollArea className="h-[200px] w-[350px] rounded-md border p-4">
    Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and leaving jokes all over the place: under the
    king's pillow, in his soup, even in the royal toilet. The king was furious, but he couldn't seem to stop Jokester.
    And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they
    couldn't help but laugh. And once they started laughing, they couldn't stop.
  </ScrollArea>
  ```
</CodeCopyBlock>

### For when you need more control

<CodeCopyBlock>
  ```tsx
  <ScrollAreaRoot className="h-[200px] w-[350px] rounded-md border p-4" type="always">
    <ScrollAreaViewport>
      So let's make trouble in the dream world Hijack heaven with another memory now I make the most of the turning tide
      It just split what's left of the burning silence Don't wait, 'cause this could be the last time You turn up in the
      reveries of my mind I wake up to a suicide frenzy Loaded dreams still leave me empty I believe Somewhere in the
      past Something was between You and I my dear And it remains With me to this day No matter what I do This wound
      will never heal Why are you never real? The shifting states you follow me through Unrevealed Just let me go or
      take me with you
    </ScrollAreaViewport>
    <ScrollBar />
  </ScrollAreaRoot>
  ```
