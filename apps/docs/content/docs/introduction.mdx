This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the component you need and copy-paste the code into your project and customize it to your needs. The code is **yours**.

_Use these components to create your own library and match your design_

What makes copy-paste different from installable libraries like MUI, Mantine, Chakra ?

      <TableCell>Harder to install</TableCell>
      <TableCell>As easy as a npm install </TableCell>

_TLDR - Faster and much easier to work with copy-paste libraries_
