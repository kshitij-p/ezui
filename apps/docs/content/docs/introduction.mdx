description: Reusable and composable components made with Radix and TailwindCSS
---

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the component you need and copy paste the code into your project and customize it to your needs. The code is **yours**.

_Use these components to create your own library and match your design_

## FAQ

<Accordion type="multiple" collapsible>

<AccordionItem value="faq-1">
	<AccordionTrigger>
		Why copy/paste and not packaged as a dependency?
	</AccordionTrigger>
	<AccordionContent>
The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the components are built and styled.

Start with some sensible defaults, then customize the components to your needs.

One of the drawback of packaging the components in an npm package is that the style is coupled with the implementation. _The design of your components should be separate from their implementation._
